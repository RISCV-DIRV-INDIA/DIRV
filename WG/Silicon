Silicon - Charter : Establish RISC-V as the foundation CPU IP with India instruction set for all silicon products owned by India

Silicon - Smart Goals
•	Develop an architecture portfolio for all product types owned by India (ranging MCU, IOT, Client, Edge, Mobility, HPC, networking, AI/ML Servers) with a common baseline architecture.
•	Deliver India oriented instruction set (baseline and extensions) for the architecture portfolio mentioned above • Develop a reference suite : tools/flows/methodologies, design, testbench, dft, implementation recipe, prototype for the different architectures mentioned above.
•	Establish an ecosystem that can help a design/product house to efficiently take the product from concept to silicon.
•	Be the innovative power house for RISC-V innovations in terms of new product types, new applications, new extensions, and new technologies.
•	Ensure that India inc has the necessary skills/expertise in silicon design to be the RISC-V power house in the world.
•	Be acknowledged as a leader of RISC-V agenda in consortiums and communities worldwide.
